1. check the all api's working or not for both container and runtime process including ws
2. dont keep static in dropdown for running commands keep it open for all 
3. always make the ws logs coming no disconnection instead of pure rest make it as ws so that it will be proper interactive 
based on proper research only 
4. then make sure to get understand the all the project details each and very bit and bytes in depth 
5. then plan for integrating in the web clearly with file editing options saving and all
